The idea here is to have a quick play with iframe behaviour and see if I can achieve the desired behaviour, then replicate it in the CMS. What we want to achieve is being able to scroll to different anchors inside an iframe (or multiple), when clicking a button/link from the PARENT page or element. Also want to check some cross origin behaviours.
