## <div style="color:#0F1A48"> iFrame Anchor Scrolling for PB</div>

The idea here is to have a quick play with iframe linking and see if I can achieve the desired behaviour, then replicate it in the CMS. 

The desired outcome is to scroll to different anchors inside an iframe (or multiple), when clicking a button/link from the PARENT page or element. Also want to check some cross origin behaviours.

Ideally scrolling parent to desired frame, along with scrolling the iframe's content.

Note: Have included some funky CSS buttons and scrolling sticky panes for various sections of the page.

Quick demo here:
