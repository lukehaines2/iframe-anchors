The idea here is to have a quick play with iframe linking and see if I can achieve the desired behaviour, then replicate it in the CMS. What we want to achieve is being able to scroll to different anchors inside an iframe (or multiple), when clicking a button/link from the PARENT page or element. Also want to check some cross origin behaviours.
Ideally scrolling parent to desired frame, along with scrolling the iframe's content.
Have included some funky CSS buttons and scrolling sticky panes for various sections of the page.
